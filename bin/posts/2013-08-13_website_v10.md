# Website v1.0

Got the pagination buttons added. [Templo](http://haxe.org/com/libs/mtwin/templo) makes it lovely and easy to add additional elements to your HTML templates conditionally. It's a much nicer syntax than trying to do it directly in php.

And now I'm pretty much done! There are a couple of bits of content missing but I have everything here to constitute a working blog. It was nice doing this because it was a much smaller project than any of the games I've been trying to write so I've been able to see it to the end. Also its been something completely new to me. Never written in Haxe or php and I've never really done any web development at all. It's all very simple stuff that I've done but I'm still proud of seeing it through for once. I've still got the content to write for the Project and About pages but I'll get that done shortly. There are some other features that I'd like to add, such as an RSS feed, a personal login page for quick blogging and maybe even a toggle to display the site in Japanese. That last one might take me a little longer than the others.

But that'll all come in time. I'm gonna keep working on this as a little side project, but now I'm gonna go back to the games.  My first task is going to be to port my current little arcade game to Haxe. Haxe will allow me to deploy it not only as a C++ standalone, but also as a flash game on the web, and even an Android game if I wanted (though it really needs a keyboard to be played so that's probably not gonna happen).

I'll be aiming to update this blog at least once a week so feel free to come back and check on my progress!
