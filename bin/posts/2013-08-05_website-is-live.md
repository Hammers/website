# Website is live !

And we have liftoff. Here's the initital launch of the website. It's written entirely in [Haxe](http://haxe.org) targetting php,
using the templo and markdown libraries. I also used [hss](http://ncannasse.fr/projects/hss) to do some fancy css stuff.
I have a pretty basic blog system which I wrote myself, but I've still got lots to work to do on it.

Upcoming features:

* URL redirection using Dispatch
* Navigation for the blog entries
* Possibly a login system so I can upload new posts from wherever.
* Actually adding content to the rest of the site

Stay tuned!
